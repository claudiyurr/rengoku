        <p>Rengoku is considered one of the most powerful and revered swordsman in the organisation. He is preceded by a long lineage of master swordsman and Flame Hashira. Kyojuro became his generation's highest skilled Flame Breathing user, mastering all techniques of the breathing style. These techniques include:</p>
        <ol>
         <li><b>Unknowing Fire </b>- The user charges towards their target at high speeds and unleashes a singular decapitating slash.</li>
         <li><b>Rising Scorching Sun</b> - The user releases an arching sword slash upwards.</li>
         <li><b>Blazing Universe</b>  - The user swings their blade downwards in an arc.</li> 
         <li><b>Blooming Flame Undulation</b> - The user's blade is swung in a circular motion that is used to defend from incoming attacks or slash multiple targets in one swoop.</li> 
         <li><b>Flame Tiger</b> - The user performs a series of powerful sword slashes that seemingly takes the form of a flaming tiger.</li>
         <li><b>Rengoku</b> - The most powerful Flame Breathing technique. The user takes a high stance with their sword before dashing forward at high speeds. The technique is powerful enough to completely carve out the ground in its wake. The user is enveloped in a fiery Japanese dragon as they charge towards the target.</li>
